<h2> What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h2>

  <ul> <li>Before this class, I had a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. I had taken a beginner website design class in high school, where I only learned the fundamentals. The class did not cover JavaScript, so everything related to that was new to me this quarter.</li></ul> ​

  <h2> Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why? ​</h2>

  <ul> <li> I did use a template for my portfolio, mostly because I liked how it looked and I liked the general CSS formatting code it came with, which made it easier to flush out the rest of the website. ​</li> </ul>

<h2> What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)? ​</h2>

  <ul> <li> Honestly, the form validation for the contact page because JavaScript never really came easily to me. Also formatting the div columns on the "Validated" page was oddly challenging.​</li></ul>

<h2> How did this class change your view on Web Development?</h2>  ​

  <ul> <li> I think I'm just shocked by how impressive big corporations' websites are, I imagine they took a lot of time and a lot of developers to make. Probably a lot of upkeep too. ​</li> </ul>

  <h2> *What would you recommend to future students taking this class?​</h2>

  <ul> <li> I would recommend just pacing out assignments, especially since life happens, and it's never fun to rush an assignment. Especially since the assignments are fun and you get out as much as you put into them. </li> </ul>
